        <h2><strong> Reading "Long Live The Web" by Tim Berners-Lee, I have been reminded of how scary it is that our data and search history are so easily
            recorded. Our network rights ares so easily violated. As Berners-Lee stated, "The goal of the Web is to serve humanity."
            Instead of having our basic human rights violated, it is important that from now on and forward, the Web's and Internet's fundamental
            principles are preserved.</strong>
